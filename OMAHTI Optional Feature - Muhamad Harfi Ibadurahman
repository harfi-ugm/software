Optional Features Implemented

1. Dark Mode and Light Mode
  ● Description: Added a dark mode feature that changes the background and text colors for a more comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions.
  ● Implementation:
    ○ Created CSS variables (--background-color, --text-color, etc.) to dynamically adjust color schemes.
    ○ JavaScript is used to toggle between dark and light modes by adding/removing a light-mode class on the body.
    ○ An icon change for the theme toggle button reflects the current mode (e.g., sun icon for light mode, moon icon for dark mode).
    ○ The dark mode setting also applies to all main components, such as the navbar, footer, buttons, and card backgrounds.

2. Interactive Links
  ● Description: All external links in the "Social" and "Information" sections are interactive and direct users to appropriate platforms.
  ● Implementation:
    ○ Social Links: Each social icon links to the relevant social media page (GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter), making it easier for users to connect with OmahTI on multiple platforms. Except github, it go to my repo
    ○ Information Links: Additional links like "About" direct users to relevant OmahTI web pages, These links enhance navigation and allow users to access related resources directly from the web app.
